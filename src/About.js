        <p className="about-columns">I am a software engineer and designer formally trained in art
        with a background in municipal service delivery. My experiences in community outreach
        and engagement have helped me learn to communicate with individuals from diverse backgrounds.
        I strive to create visually interesting solutions that are broadly appealing.  I believe tech
        should be intuitive, welcoming and delightful to interact with. In my current position as an
        Interaction Engineer at Triplelift, I create bespoke, consumer-centric ad templates and help to
        develop the tools to create those templates.</p>
