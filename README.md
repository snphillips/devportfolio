### About a Blue Bike
About a Blue Bike is a tool to look up statistics on individual bicycles in New York City's Citibike bike share system.

Every Citibike has a unique identification number that is prominently printed on every bike. Users of About a Blue Bike input a bike id into a field and are presented with a narrative that includes the length of time that bike has been on the road, how many miles the bike had travelled and which docking stations it has visited.

Background
DSNY collects residential and public school refuse and recycling, empties street litter baskets, cleans up abandoned property such as cars, tires and bicycles and collects other types of refuse, such as the detritus left in public spaces after Superstorm Sandy. DSNY does not pick up commercial refuse from offices, shops, business, institutions or construction sites.

DSNY publishes monthly reports detailing how many tons of refuse, paper/cardboard and metal/glass/plastic/drink carton has been collected, categorized by borough and further categorized into Community District (CD). Currently the monthly report does not contain data on how much organic material is being collected.
